"Digital art style children's book cover illustration. Geffen, a 1-year-old boy with bright blue hair that sticks up in tufts and wide, curious blue eyes, wearing a tiny blue and white striped sailor suit, is swimming underwater surrounded by Shelly, a wise old sea turtle with a cracked, green shell covered in barnacles and kind, brown eyes, Finn, a playful, orange fish with large, expressive eyes and shimmering scales, and Octavia, a gentle, purple octopus with long, flowing tentacles and big, intelligent eyes. A sunken ship is in the background. The title \"Geffen's Sea Adventure\" is placed at the top in a large, playful font."
